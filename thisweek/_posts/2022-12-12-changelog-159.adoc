* pr:13725[] resolve associated constants of traits.
* pr:13728[] upgrade `chalk` to make solver fuel work again (works around most trait solving hangs).

== Fixes

* pr:13749[] don't show duplicated adjustment hints for blocks, ``if``s and ``match``es.
* pr:13742[] only shift ``BoundVar``s that come from outside lowering context (fixes a crash with GATs).
* pr:13750[] normalize projection after discarding free ``BoundVar``s in RPIT (fixes a crash during normalization).

== Internal Improvements

* pr:13722[] add VS Code schema for `rust-project.json`.
* pr:13730[] support built-in derive macro helper attributes.
* pr:13756[] make `assoc_resolutions` always have a `Substitution`.
