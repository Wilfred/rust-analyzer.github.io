== A Note on Today's Release

Because of an infrastructure issue, today's release is not available on the VS Code Marketplace and OpenVSX.
The VSIX can still be downloaded manually from GitHub Releases, and Code should be able to update it automatically in the future.

We hope we can get everything sorted out by next Monday.

== New Features

* pr:14742[] add closure capture inlay hints, disabled by default:
