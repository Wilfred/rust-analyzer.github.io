== An Update on OpenVSX ==

Many users of VS Code are actually running an open-source version of the editor.
These include VSCodium and the `code` package in Arch Linux.
The "free" builds are not allowed to connect to the Microsoft Marketplace and instead they download extensions from https://open-vsx.org[OpenVSX].

For a long time, the version of rust-analyzer available on OpenVSX was outdated and did not work very well with recent Rust toolchains.
But because of various technical reasons, we were not able to publish new versions there.
This caused countless of disappointed users, and dozens of duplicate issues filed against our tracker.

Last week, with the help of the OpenVSX maintainers, we managed to sort out the issues.
And for the first time in almost a year, rust-analyzer is https://open-vsx.org/extension/rust-lang/rust-analyzer[available] on OpenVSX.
Unfortunately, we had to remove the existing versions, under the identifier of `matklad.rust-analyzer`.
If you have that version installed, it will not be automatically switched over to the new one (`rust-lang.rust-analyzer`).

So if you are not running a Microsoft build of VS Code, our advice is to reinstall rust-analyzer from Code's extension page.
This will ensure that you get updated versions in the future.
If you've installed a VSIX from GitHub since March, it should get updated automatically, but it doesn't hurt to check.

If you are using an official build of Code, or a different editor, you don't need to take any action.
