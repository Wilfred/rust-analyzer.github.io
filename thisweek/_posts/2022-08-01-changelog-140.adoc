== An Update on Proc Macros

Rust toolchains newer than `2022-07-29` contain a proc macro server that should be compatible with macros built by the matching compiler.
Since today's release, the server is automatically detected by and used `rust-analyzer`.
This means that, from now on, proc macros will keep working when the `proc_macro` crate changes.

For more details, you can read @fasterthanlime's https://fasterthanli.me/articles/proc-macro-support-in-rust-analyzer-for-nightly-rustc-versions#what-s-next[blog post].
