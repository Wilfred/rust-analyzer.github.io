* pr:14837[] support C string literals.
* pr:14787[] MIR episode 5, lower slice patterns and anonymous `const` blocks.

== Fixes

* pr:14848[] (first contribution) traverse `else` blocks of `let-else` in `preorder_expr`.
* pr:14809[] support `#[macro_use(name, ...)]`.
* pr:14824[] diagnose non-value `return` and `break` type mismatches.
* pr:14825[] fix evaluation of negation for floating point types.
* pr:14828[] process `macro_use` prelude in semantic scope resolver.
* pr:14823[] only render discriminant hints for data-carrying enums with primitive `repr`.
* pr:14822[] force-disable the `augmentsSyntaxTokens` capability on VS Code.
* pr:14802[] fix layout for `hir_ty::Ty` and friends.
* pr:14820[] expand `format_args!` with more details.
* pr:14851[] handle match scrutinee in closure captures.
* pr:14855[] consider block impls in `lookup_impl_assoc_item_for_trait_ref`.
* pr:14863[] consider all tokens in macro calls when analyzing locals.

== Internal Improvements

* pr:14746[] parse unstable associated return type bounds.
* pr:14794[], pr:14818[], pr:14835[] restructure `InlayHint`, no longer derive properties from its kind.
* pr:14810[] inline handlers module.
* pr:14834[] do less file parsing for symbol index generation.

* pr:14843[] partially support panic message in `MirEvalError`.
* pr:14847[] reduce MIR memory usage.
* pr:14857[] shrink `ProcMacroExpander` from 8 to 4 bytes.
* pr:14819[] fix division by zero in `analysis-stats`.
